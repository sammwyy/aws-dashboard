# üå∏ AWS PoC

Proof of concept on re-design for the AWS dashboard (Amazon Web Services) built in React, Sass, Chakra-UI and Choc-UI.

### ü§î Why?

I am practicing UI / UX development and it seemed like an excellent idea to redesign the AWS dashboard, since it does not seem very intuitive or practical for new users. My goal is to develop a panel that adapts to any user, whether advanced or beginner, and that feels comfortable in sight as well as having all the useful shortcuts and everything in its corresponding place.

### üìù ToDo

- [x] Upload project.
- [ ] Make it responsive.
- [ ] Create routes and view for services.
- [ ] Create routes and view for support.
- [ ] Create routes and view for invoice.
- [ ] Create routes and view for explorer.
- [ ] Create routes and view for marketplace. 
- [ ] Add placeholder authentication.
- [ ] Protect routes with fake authentication.
